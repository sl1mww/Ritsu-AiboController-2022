# Ritsu-AiboController-2022

Hello world!
This is a collaborative project between sl1mww (Shaun Lim W.W.) and Ian Suzuki for our university Project-Based-Learning (PBL) class.

This is a complete controller (PBLaibo22.py) for the ERS-1000 Aibo robot by Sony which will allow developers to control the robot using:
1. GUI interface (implemented using tkinter)
2. Xbox controllers (*ONLY available on Windows OS)

Feel free to improve on our simple code!
